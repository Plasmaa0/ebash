# Delete file
You should just copy a single file in home directory to another directory with new name.
File name is "copy_me.txt".
To copy file you should use ```cp``` command.

You can use it such way:
```cp filepath/filename new_filepath/new_filename```
New directory is `copy_here`.
New file_name is `exbash.txt`.

So finally you should do this
COPY ~/copy_me.txt -> ~/copy_here/exbash.txt

GOOD LUCK!
