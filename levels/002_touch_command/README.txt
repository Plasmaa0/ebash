Create 'file.txt' in home directory

The touch command is the most commonly used command for creating a new file in Linux. 

To create a new file in the current directory, 
you need to run the touch command followed by the name of the file. 

This will create a file with the file name you entered.

For example
```bash
touch hello.txt
```
