To move file you should use 'mv' command.
Simply you can use it such way:
'mv <from-directory>/<filename> <to-directory>'
If you are already in the same directory as a file you can skip <from-directory>:
'mv <filename> <to-directory>'

To rename file you just move it in the same directory as it was before but with different name:
'mv <previous_name> <new_name>'
