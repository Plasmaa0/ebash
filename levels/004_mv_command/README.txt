- The "mv" command in Linux is used to move or rename files and directories.
- It can be used to move a file from one directory to another, or to rename a file within the same directory.
- When renaming a file, the "mv" command simply changes the name of the file without altering its contents.
- If there is already a file with the same name in the destination directory, the "mv" command will overwrite it.
- The "mv" command can also be used to move multiple files at once by specifying a wildcard pattern.
